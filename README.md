## Development

Feel free to submit a PR or submit and issue or suggestion for future features / direction of the app!

Percent integrates with Mailchimp & Sendgrid for serving onboarding emails & updating the weekly newletter recipients. If you want to work/upgrade these features, make sure you create a file in `/config` called `local_env.yml` to look like this:
```sh
SENDGRID_USERNAME: 'username@sendgrid.com' # sendgrid account that will fire off welcome and goodbye emails
SENDGRID_PASSWORD: 'yoursendgridpassword'

MAILCHIMP_API_KEY: 'yourmailchimpapikey'
TEST_MAILCHIMP_LISTID: 'listid' # id of the list users will be added/removed from during testing
```
